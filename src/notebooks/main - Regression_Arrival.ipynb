    "### Target Encoding with K-Fold\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`target_encoding_kfold`** function applies **Target Encoding** with **K-Fold Cross Validation** to prevent **data leakage** during training, ensuring the model only learns from training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **K-Fold Validation**:\n",
    "   - Splits the training data into **n_splits** (default 5) using **StratifiedKFold** to ensure balanced target distribution.\n",
    "   - Prevents **data leakage** by ensuring encoding is only based on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resetting Indices**:\n",
    "   - Resets indices in both train and validation sets to avoid **index misalignment** when applying target encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smoothing**:\n",
    "   - Calculates the category mean with a smoothing technique that combines the category mean with the global mean to handle sparse categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mapping and Handling Unseen Categories**:\n",
    "   - Categories in validation and test sets are **mapped** to the calculated target mean; missing categories are assigned the **global mean** to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why K-Fold?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K-Fold** ensures that encoding is done only with training data, preventing future data from contaminating the model and causing **data leakage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach guarantees **robust target encoding**, preserves model integrity, and prevents **overfitting**.\n"
